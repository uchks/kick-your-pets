## kick-your-pets
A self-bot to ban all [spy.pet](https://spy.pet) bots from the following endpoint: <br>
https://kickthespy.pet/ids  <br>

### Run:
`.env`:
```
USER_TOKEN = your_user_token
```
bot:
```
> bun index.ts
Logged in as your_username!
Please enter the guild ID: enter_guild_id_here
```

Self-bots are against [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms). Do not use this without knowing you could *possibly* get banned. <br>
 
Realistically, this isn't going to stop anything, these scrapers are not just spy.pet, there's other people doing it too. <br>
But if you want to feel just a tiny bit better, here's a self-bot.

<sub>Ignore the dark name.</sub>
